## University Student Schedule - USS

This program is designed for ***post-secondary school students***. The application will have three main functions: 


- Display some sort of visual representation of class times once the courses and their times are added.
- Help the user learn more about the minimum and maximum hours they will spend on their courses each day or month for a certain term.
- Generate a difficulty out of 5 for the workload. Students will then be able to compare this number to that of their classmates (once their classmates also use the program and learn their term difficulty).

Additionally, students might also be interested in comparing the difficulties of their first and second term, and they can do that as well.

*This project interests me because I have always found selecting courses an enjoyable process, and being more careful with the selections will make a huge difference in terms of school / life balance*. Simply switching two courses between terms or deciding to take a course during the summer term can impact grades, stress levels, and lifestyle during a term.
